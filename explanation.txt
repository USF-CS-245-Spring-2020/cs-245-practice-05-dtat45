The algorithm that I used is a modified version of count sort. In this version of count sort,
numbers are split into different 'buckets' based on the ones value of each number. The numbers
are then placed back into the original array starting from the 0 bucket until the final element
in bucket 9. This process is repeated for the tens value, hundreds value, and the thousands value.
When the thousands value finishes sorting, the array should be fully sorted.
